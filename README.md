# RevMetrixUI

This is a current Cs320 team project where we will be creating a UI for the RevMetrix capstone project. 

## Project Overview
The RevMetrix Bowler UI helps bowlers record, track, and analyze their performance. It provides comprehensive statistics and graphs for performance analysis.

## Basic Functionality
Bowling: Users select event, establishment, session, lanes, and balls before bowling. The UI tracks game progress and scores automatically.

Statistics: Users retrieve league averages, game averages, trend graphs, high/low games, score histograms, pocket quality, strike/spare percentages, and more.

## Additional Components
Account/Event/Ball/Establishment Registration: Users can create accounts and register events, bowling balls, and establishments.
